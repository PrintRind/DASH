These are basic numerical simulations for the methods DASH and c-DASH as published in the paper Nam et. al.

"DASH_published" is the most basic simulation and available as Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) as well. 

The simulation assumes that a 2D phase scatterer is in the same optical plane as the spatial light modulator. 
The scatterer is defined by its peak-to-valley phase P2V and a parameter defining its spatial frequency. 
The sample is assumed to be in the focal plane and can be chosen to be either a single pixel in the focal plane ("bead") or a homogeneous 2D fluorescent layer ("plane")

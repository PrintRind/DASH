These are basic numerical simulations for the methods DASH and c-DASH as published in the paper Nam et. al.
DASH_published is the most basic simulation and available as Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) as well. 

The simulation assumes that a phase scatterer is in the same optical plane as the spatial light modulator.
